Now, we will begin by implementing the single linked list in C. This implementation should include insertion, printing, deletion, and traversal functions. Further, you must write your code in a way to avoid memory leaks. I have included in this project a Makefile for you to use. This Makefile uses a couple of flags that will make your code more robust. Further, in order for me to accept this assignment, I will run your code through Valgrind/GDB to make sure there are no memory leaks. I have also included a header file for this assignment. It includes all of the function prototypes that you must implement in the `sll.c` file.
